Traffic, shipping, construction, and industrial activity generate sound that penetrates virtually every habitat on Earth, from city parks to the deep ocean. Our research investigates how this global pollutant affects animal behaviour, communication, and fitness, with the aim of understanding the full scope of its biological consequences and informing mitigation strategies.\n\n    Noise Affects Behaviour Across Sensory Modalities\n    \n      \n    \n    One of our most striking findings is that noise does not only affect hearing. It disrupts behaviour across multiple sensory channels. Working in the marine environment, we demonstrated that anthropogenic noise alters the behaviour of animals that do not primarily rely on acoustic communication. This cross-modal effect suggests that the biological impacts of noise pollution are far more widespread than previously assumed, affecting species and behaviours that were not considered vulnerable. Our work on sea turtles further showed that anthropogenic noise predicts behavioural responses in marine reptiles, a group rarely studied in the context of noise pollution.\n\n    \n    Disrupting Communication and Social Behaviour\n    \n      \n    \n    Noise can mask acoustic signals, forcing animals to change how they communicate. We showed that experimentally increased noise levels cause birds to change both their spatial behaviour and their singing patterns. In cichlid fish, noise alters fundamental behaviours including foraging and sheltering, not just communication. Importantly, noise also disrupts how animals interact: vocal exchanges between neighbouring territory holders are affected by anthropogenic noise, potentially altering the dynamics of territorial systems. We found that noise interferes with how fighting fish assess opponents during contests. Signal complexity, which normally communicates aggressive intent, is disrupted under noisy conditions, and noise changes how animals evaluate resources during territorial disputes.\n\n    \n    From Terrestrial to Aquatic Systems\n    \n      \n    \n    Our research spans both terrestrial and aquatic environments, reflecting the fact that noise pollution is a truly global problem. We published a synthesis arguing that aquatic noise pollution has consequences that extend beyond individual animals to populations and ecosystems. Underwater noise from shipping, sonar, and construction can propagate over vast distances, and many aquatic organisms, from fish to invertebrates, are sensitive to these disturbances. We demonstrated that even invertebrates, which were long overlooked in noise research, show measurable behavioural responses to anthropogenic noise, including altered resource assessment.\n\n    \n    Phenotypic Plasticity and Behavioural Adjustment\n    \n      \n    \n    A recurring theme in our work is the question of whether animals can adjust to noise through behavioural plasticity. We showed that phenotypic plasticity affects how a sexually selected trait, song in birds, responds to anthropogenic noise. While some degree of adjustment is possible, such plasticity comes with potential costs: signals modified to cope with noise may be less effective at attracting mates or deterring rivals. Understanding the limits of plastic responses is critical for predicting which species can cope with increasing noise levels and which cannot.\n\n    \n    ← Back to Research Overview"

From the dawn song of nightingales to the begging calls of meerkat pups, acoustic signals mediate mate attraction, territory defence, parent/offspring interactions, and competitive encounters. Our research investigates how these signals evolve, how they function in natural social networks, and how flexible animals are in adjusting their communication when conditions change.\n\n    Vocal Interactions and Social Networks\n    \n      \n    \n    Much of our early work focused on the common nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos), one of Europe's most accomplished songsters. We showed that vocal interactions between territorial males carry real consequences: males that respond more aggressively to rivals during nocturnal singing bouts have higher pairing success, while paired males reduce their vocal investment after securing a mate. By studying dawn song across the breeding season, we demonstrated that song characteristics change systematically, reflecting shifts in the social and ecological pressures males face. We also discovered that non-territorial males prospect occupied territories during the dawn chorus, using the information contained in these vocal displays to assess potential rivals and settlement options. This body of work revealed that communication networks, where multiple individuals simultaneously signal and eavesdrop, are a key feature of acoustic signalling systems.\n\n    \n    Begging and Parent/Offspring Communication\n    \n      \n    \n    Our research on cooperative breeders, particularly meerkats (Suricata suricatta), explored how offspring communicate their needs to caregivers. We investigated the evolution of begging signals in a mobile feeding system, where pups follow foraging groups rather than waiting at a fixed nest. We found that different call types serve distinct functions in this context, and that pups show sophisticated strategies in how they direct their begging, targeting helpers that feed at higher rates. We also examined why pups eventually stop begging as they grow older, and how sex differences in responsiveness to begging calls shape helper behaviour. This work highlighted the complexity of parent/offspring and carer/offspring communication in social species.\n\n    \n    Signal Complexity and Contest Behaviour\n    \n      \n    \n    Animal signals are often complex, combining multiple components that convey different types of information. We studied Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) to understand how signal complexity communicates aggressive intent during contests. Using an integrative analysis approach, we showed that fish assess each other through a combination of visual displays and behavioural signals, and that the complexity of these strategies plays a crucial role in determining contest outcomes.\n\n    \n    Acoustic Signals and Personality\n    \n      \n    \n    Individual animals differ consistently in their behaviour, a phenomenon often referred to as animal personality. We investigated whether these individual differences are reflected in vocal signals, using domestic pigs as a model system. We demonstrated that vocalisations carry information about the caller's personality traits, and that the acoustic structure of calls differs systematically between positive and negative contexts, with call duration being a reliable predictor. These findings suggest that vocal signals may provide a non-invasive tool for assessing animal welfare.\n\n    \n    ← Back to Research Overview"

Meta-analysis allows us to move beyond individual results and ask: what is the overall evidence telling us? By quantitatively combining findings from studies conducted across different species, ecosystems, and continents, we can identify broad biological patterns that no single study could reveal. This approach has become central to our research programme, particularly in understanding the global impacts of anthropogenic noise on wildlife.\n\n    Our meta-analytical work follows best practices in quantitative research synthesis. We use comprehensive literature searches, transparent inclusion criteria, and modern statistical techniques, including multilevel meta-analytic models that account for the non-independence of effect sizes from the same study or species. We believe that rigorous meta-analysis is essential for evidence-based conservation and for advancing ecological theory.\n\n    The Lombard Effect Across Vertebrates\n    \n      \n    \n    More than 100 years ago, Etienne Lombard discovered that humans increase how loud they speak when exposed to background noise. Since then, this \"Lombard effect\" has attracted interest from disciplines ranging from linguistics to zoology. One unresolved question concerned its evolutionary origin: the Lombard effect had been found in birds, mammals, and fish, but not in reptiles, and in amphibians the evidence was disputed. Using a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis, we showed that the Lombard effect is a widespread mechanism in vertebrates, and that amplitude adjustments require neither complex cortical processes nor vocal learning. This finding has important implications for understanding how animals cope with noisy environments, because it demonstrates that vocal plasticity is not restricted to a few species but represents a fundamental feature of vertebrate communication.\n\n    \n    Species Sensitivities to Noise\n    \n      \n    \n    Not all species respond to noise in the same way. In a comprehensive meta-analysis, we examined how anthropogenic noise affects acoustic signals across a wide range of species. By synthesising data from numerous studies, we identified systematic differences in how species adjust their signals in response to noise. These species-level sensitivities have direct conservation implications: they help us predict which species are most vulnerable to increasing noise levels and where mitigation efforts should be focused. This work demonstrated the power of meta-analysis to move the field from documenting effects in individual species to understanding patterns at a global scale.\n\n    \n    The Broad Biological Consequences of Noise\n    \n      \n    \n    Our first meta-analysis tackled a fundamental question: does anthropogenic noise affect animals? By bringing together studies that measured a wide range of responses to noise, we showed that noise affects both invertebrates and vertebrates. This was among the first quantitative demonstrations that noise pollution is not merely a nuisance but a biologically meaningful stressor with measurable consequences for wildlife. The study has been influential in policy discussions around noise regulation and environmental impact assessment.\n\n    \n    ← Back to Research Overview"
